Estimating the running cost of the infrastructure depends on several factors including the AWS region, specific usage patterns, and any applicable discounts or reserved instance pricing. Below, Iâ€™ll provide a detailed breakdown of the expected costs for each component based on typical on-demand pricing as of 2024. Please note that these are estimates and you should verify the latest prices directly from AWS for your exact configuration and region.

### 1. VPC and Networking Costs

**VPC and Subnets**:
- **VPC**: No additional cost.
- **Subnets**: No additional cost.

**Internet Gateway**:
- **AWS Internet Gateway**: $0.005 per GB data processed (outbound only).

**NAT Gateway**:
- **NAT Gateway**: $0.045 per hour.
- **Data Transfer**: $0.045 per GB processed.

**Elastic IP (EIP)**:
- **Elastic IP**: Free when associated with a running instance, otherwise $0.005 per hour.

### 2. RDS PostgreSQL Instance Costs

**RDS Instance**:
- **Instance Type**: `db.t3.micro`.
  - **On-Demand**: Approx. $0.018 per hour in the `us-west-2` region (about $13.14 per month).
  - **Storage**: General Purpose (SSD) storage (`gp2`) costs $0.115 per GB-month.

**Backup Storage**:
- **Free backup storage**: Up to the allocated storage capacity is free for automated backups; additional storage costs $0.095 per GB-month.

**Data Transfer**:
- **Inbound Data Transfer**: Free.
- **Outbound Data Transfer**: Starts at $0.09 per GB for the first 10 TB per month.

**CloudWatch Logs**:
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Ingestion and storage pricing apply.
  - **Ingestion**: $0.50 per GB.
  - **Storage**: $0.03 per GB-month.

### 3. S3 Storage Costs

**S3 Standard Storage**:
- **Storage Cost**: $0.023 per GB-month for the first 50 TB per month.
- **Requests**:
  - PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST requests: $0.005 per 1,000 requests.
  - GET, SELECT, and all other requests: $0.0004 per 1,000 requests.

### Estimated Monthly Cost Breakdown

#### VPC and Networking
- **NAT Gateway**:
  - Hours: 730 hours/month (assuming always on).
  - Cost: 730 hours x $0.045/hour = $32.85/month.
  - Data Processing: 10 GB/month x $0.045/GB = $0.45/month (assuming minimal usage).

#### RDS PostgreSQL Instance
- **Instance Cost**:
  - Monthly usage: 730 hours/month.
  - Cost: 730 hours x $0.018/hour = $13.14/month.
- **Storage Cost**:
  - Allocated Storage: 20 GB x $0.115/GB-month = $2.30/month.
  - Auto-scaling Storage (example, 10 GB growth): 10 GB x $0.115/GB-month = $1.15/month.
- **Backup Storage**: Assuming backups are within the allocated storage limit, no extra cost.

#### S3 Storage
- **Storage Cost**:
  - Assuming 10 GB of storage: 10 GB x $0.023/GB-month = $0.23/month.
- **Request Cost**: Minimal usage, say 1,000 PUT and 10,000 GET requests:
  - PUT Requests: 1,000 requests x $0.005/1,000 = $0.005.
  - GET Requests: 10,000 requests x $0.0004/1,000 = $0.004.

### Total Estimated Monthly Cost

Summing up all the components:

| Component              | Cost Estimate (per month) |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| NAT Gateway (Hours)    | $32.85                    |
| NAT Gateway (Data)     | $0.45                     |
| RDS Instance           | $13.14                    |
| RDS Storage (20 GB)    | $2.30                     |
| RDS Additional Storage | $1.15                     |
| S3 Storage (10 GB)     | $0.23                     |
| S3 Requests            | $0.009                    |
| **Total**              | **$50.129**               |

### Additional Considerations
- **Data Transfer Costs**: Outbound data transfer costs can significantly increase if you transfer large amounts of data out of AWS.
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Depending on log volume, these can also add to the costs.
- **Reserved Instances**: Using reserved instances for RDS can lower the cost significantly if you commit to a one or three-year term.
